root(method=’df-sane’):
    fatol: norm has to be bigger than fatol to end
    norm: norm is function that calculates the norm: I do max(abs(X))
    ftol: It depends on the starting approximation. Should be 0 to have expected behaveour!!
    ||func(x)|| < fatol + ftol ||func(x_0)||.

xtol: |x_iter-1 / x_iter -1| has to be smaller than xtol

eps: it is a parameter that is used in calculation of the jacobian matrix and it tells us what to use as deltax when calculating derivatives
